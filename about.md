I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Department of Civil Engineering at the University of Minho, and a member of the Structural Concrete (SC) Group of the Institute for Sustainability and Innovation in Structural Engineering (ISISE). Our research focuses on the conservation of existing concrete constructions, and to the development of innovative solutions for new concrete and composite constructions, by using advanced cement and polymer based materials reinforced with discrete and continuous fibres (fibre reinforced cement composites, FRCC, and fibre reinforced polymers, FRP). My research interests also include Structural Analysis, Concrete Engineering, Numerical and Computational Methods and Software Engineering.

I am a Chartered Civil Engineer of the Order of Engineers of Portugal and Brazil. I am also an Associate Member of the Order of Musicians of Brazil.

Outside of my teaching and research, I pursue several other interests. These include reading history, philosophy, science and technical books. I love coding software and playing music. Music means everything to me, I could not live without music. I really love playing the piano and guitar.
